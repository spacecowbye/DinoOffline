# DinoOffline
Play dinosaur game online with hand gestures.
When your internet is not working and you are too lazy to play the game with your keyboard, you can play the offline game using hand gestures. If you hold up all the five fingers, the dino will jump, basically on holding out all the five fingers the spacebar is pressed.
After running the game go to www.google.com after disconnecting from your wifi, you can alsp place the opencv-window and minimize it so you can see your hand gestures are being recognized.
